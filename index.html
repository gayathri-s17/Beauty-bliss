<div class="primer">
</p><img src="primer.jpg" width="300px" height="300px"><i>
<br><br><br><strong>Primers</strong> are used on the face before makeup is applied, creating a typically transparent, smooth layer over the top of the skin, allowing for makeup to be applied smoothly and evenly. Some primers may also be tinted, and this tint may match the wearer's skin tone or may colour correct it, using greens, oranges, and purples to even out the wearer's skin tone and correct redness, purple shadows, or orange discolouration respectively</i>.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

</div>
<div class="concealer">

<img src="concealer.jpg" width="300px" height="300px">
<p><i><strong>Concealer</strong> is a cream or liquid product used to conceal marks or blemishes on the skin. Concealer is typically the colour of the user's skin tone and is generally applied after the face has been primed to even out the wearer's skin tone before foundation can be applied. Concealer is usually more heavily pigmented, has higher coverage, and is thicker than foundation or tinted primers. Though concealer is often more heavy duty in terms of pigment and consistency than foundation, a number of different formulations intended for different styles of use, such as a lighter concealer for the eyes and a heavier concealer for stage makeup, are available, as well as color-correcting concealers intended to balance out discolouration of the skin specifically</i>.</p><br><br><br><br><br>


</div>
<div class="foundation">

<img src="foundation.webp" width="300px" height="300px">
<p><i><strong>Foundation</strong> is a cream, liquid, mousse, or powder product applied to the entirety of the face to create a smooth and even base for the user's skin tone. Foundation provides a generally lower amount of coverage than concealer and is sold in formulations that can provide sheer, matte, dewy or full coverage to the skin</i>.[5]</p><br><br><br><br><br<br><br><br><br>


</div>
<div class="eyeliner">

<img src="eyeliner.webp" width="300px" height="300px">

<p><i><strong>Eyeliner</strong> is used to enhance and elongate the apparent size or depth of the eye. Though eyeliner is commonly black, it can come in many different colours. Eyeliner can come in the form of a pencil, a gel or a liquid</i>.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


</p>
</div>
<div class="mascara">

<img src="mascara.png" width="300px" height="300px">

<p><i><strong>Mascara </strong>is used to darken, lengthen, thicken, or enhance the eyelashes through the use of a typically thick, cream-like product applied with a spiral bristle mascara brush. Mascara is commonly black, brown, or clear, though a number of different colours, some containing glitter, are available. Mascara is typically advertised and sold in a number of different formulations that advertise qualities such as waterproofing, volume enhancement, length enhancement, and curl enhancement, and may be used in combination with an eyelash curler to enhance the natural curl of the eyelashes</i>.[5]</p><br><br><br><br><br>

<div class="lipstick">

<img src="lipstick.webp" width="300px" height="300px">

<p><i><strong>Lip products</strong>, including lipstick, lip gloss, lip liner and lip balms, commonly add color and texture to the lips, as well as serving to moisturise the lips and define their external edges.[5] Products adding colour and texture to the lips, such as lipsticks and lip glosses, often come in a wide range of colors as well as a number of different finishes, such as matte finishes and satin or glossy finishes. Other styles of lip coloration products, such as lip stains, temporarily saturate the lips with a dye and typically do not alter the texture of the lips. Both lip colour products and lip liners may be waterproof and may be applied directly to the lips, with a brush, or with the fingers. Lip balms, though designed to moisturise and protect the lips (such as through the addition of UV protection) may also tint the lips</i>.</p><br><br><br><br>

<div class="moisturizer">

<img src="moistur.webp" width="300px" height="300px">
<p><i><strong>Moisturizers</strong> are creams or lotions that hydrate the skin and help it to retain moisture. Typical components are polyols such as glycerol and sorbitol as well as partially hydrolyzed proteins.[1] Tinted moisturizers contain a small amount of foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad</i>.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<div class="sunscreen">


<img src="sunscreens.webp" width="300px" height="300px">

<p><i><strong>Sunscreens </strong>are creams, lotions, sprays, gels, sticks, or other topical projects that protect the skin from the sun. They contain organic or inorganic filters that act to absorb or reflect harmful UV radiation.[25] Sunscreens are marked with'spf', which means'sun protection factor.' This shows that a product provides protection against UVB.[25] UVA ratings on sunscreens can be denoted by the number of stars or plus symbols varying among countries.[26] It is to be noted that UVA ratings do not specifically depict the amount of UVA protection a sunscreen is providing but rather the ratio of equal UVA and UVB protection.[26] The recommended 'gold standard' of a sunscreen should be at least SPF 30 and at least 4 stars or plus symbols.[26] Daily sunscreen application is very important, but uses of shade, clothing, and hats are as important and more effective for sun protection</i>.</p><br><br><br><br>

<div class="serum">
<img src="fserum.webp" width="300px" height="300px">

<p><i><strong>Serums </strong>are light, easily absorbed liquids that one spreads on their skin. The main purpose of the product is to be applied before moisturizer, and the serum provides a high concentration of any specific ingredient on the face. The benefits of serum are skin firmness, smoothness of the face, and reducing the fine lines and wrinkles on ones face</i>.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
